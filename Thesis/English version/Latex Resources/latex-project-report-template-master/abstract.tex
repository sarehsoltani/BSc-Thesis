	In most computer vision and image analysis problems, it is necessary to define a similarity measure between two or more different objects or images. Template matching is a classic and fundamental method used to score similarities between objects using certain mathematical algorithms\cite{abstract}. In this project, we'll propose two implementations of image template matching in CUDA. Our first method is based on the \textit{naive} version of the template matching and the second method is based on the \textit{Fast Fourier Transform} algorithm.
