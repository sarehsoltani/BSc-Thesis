\chapter{Conclusion}
In this project, we analyzed various algorithms for the task of \textit{Image Template Matching}. It is fair to say that there are already highly optimized libraries with template matching capabilities such as \textit{OpenCV}, but as mentioned before, the main purpose of this project is to improve the understanding of the CUDA environment and parallel implementation of highly-demanded computer vision tasks such as template matching.
We analyzed two main methods to perform this task:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Naive Template Matching
	\item FFT Based Template Matching
\end{enumerate}
For further read, please refer to methods such as \textit{Stereo Matching}, \textit{Image Registration} and \textit{Scale Invariant Feature Transform}.
