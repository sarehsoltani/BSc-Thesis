\chapter{Future Work}
We admit the possible drawbacks and inefficiencies existing in this project, thus we have the following key improvement to-do list:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reorganization of the project structure, header files and .c files.
	\item Reorganization of the project source code for a C unified implementation.
	\item Usage shared memory techniques to improve the performance of the \textit{NTM} implementation.
	\item Usage of highly-optimized image libraries such as \textit{OpenCV} for \textit{image rotation}, \textit{image matrix extraction} and general \textit{bitmap processing}.
	\item Implementation of CUDA kernels for real-to-complex signal conversions.
	\item Implementation of CUDA kernel to find the number of occurrences of template signal in main signal in \textit{Fourier} based template matching.
\end{itemize}
